            Turning the Tide in Busia County
          </h2>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            Along the shores of Lake Victoria, in Runyu Village, a generation of young people faces 
            an uncertain future. Most have dropped out of school, struggling to survive through precarious 
            fishing, often caught in cycles of poverty, drug abuse, and disease.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet, beneath these challenges lies something powerful, Their potential.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            At Elimu Community Network (ECN), we believe that when young people are given the tools to learn, 
            innovate, and lead, they can turn survival into sustainability and despair into discovery.
          </p>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            That‚Äôs why we launched Blue Horizons.  A ground breaking youth initiative designed to reshape the 
            fishing industry through education, technology, and entrepreneurship.

            What We Do
          </h2>
          <p className="leading-relaxed">
            Blue Horizons empowers vulnerable youth to become champions of sustainable fishing, innovation, and community development.<br />
            Through hands-on learning and mentorship, the program explores the entire fishing value chain, from sustainable 
            practices to high-tech solutions and business creation.<br />
            Our approach blends traditional wisdom with modern technology, creating a model of learning that is both relevant and transformative.

            <li>
              <strong>Sustainable Fishing Education:</strong><br /> We train youth on eco-friendly fishing 
              practices, lake conservation, and community stewardship.
            They learn to protect biodiversity, use the right tools, and safeguard the lake‚Äôs ecosystem by 
            ensuring that fishing today does not destroy tomorrow.<br />
            ‚ÄúWe teach them to fish but also to think, innovate, and sustain.‚Äù
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Technology Meets Tradition: </strong><br /> At our solar-powered digital training hub in Runyu 
              Village, young people gain essential ICT and AI skills.
                They learn how to use data and technology to map fish resources, improve marketing, and apply artificial 
                intelligence in managing fisheries.<br />
                From digital literacy to AI for aquaculture, this is where the future of fishing goes smart.
            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Value Addition and Entrepreneurship</strong><br /> Fishing is more than catching fish, it‚Äôs about creating value.<br />
            Youth are trained to process, dry, and package fish sustainably, while also exploring innovative by-products like fish oil, 
            animal feed, and organic fertilizer.<br />  
            They also receive coaching in entrepreneurship, cooperative formation, and financial literacy, turning their skills into sustainable businesses.

            </li>
            <li>
              <strong>Connecting to Markets</strong><br /> ECN builds market linkages between youth-led enterprises and major cities like 
              Kisumu, Nairobi, and Mombasa.<br />   
            Future phases will expand across Uganda and Tanzania, building a vibrant East African network of young innovators in the blue economy.<br />    
            This is how local talent becomes regional impact.
