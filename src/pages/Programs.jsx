      Every day, the streets of our cities fill with waste ‚Äî plastic
       bottles, discarded paper, and forgotten metal. But to the street 
       youth of Kenya, this isn‚Äôt just trash.
       <br></br>
       It‚Äôs a chance to learn, to earn, and to lead.
    </p>
     <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      Urban Green Minds is a transformative ECN initiative that turns the 
      challenges of urban waste into opportunities for education, innovation, and sustainable livelihoods.

    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      Learning to Clean the City and the Future

      At the heart of Urban Green Minds is one simple belief:
      <br></br>
      <strong>Education changes everything, even how we see waste.</strong>
    </p>
    <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      Through fun, hands-on lessons, street-connected youth discover how the waste that clutters their
      communities can become a source of income, creativity, and pride.
      <br></br>
      From sorting plastics to understanding pollution, they learn the science of waste ‚Äî and how caring
       for the environment begins with small, everyday actions.

      This isn‚Äôt yesterday‚Äôs waste collection. It‚Äôs smart, tech-driven recycling for the future.
      Using solar-powered learning hubs, youth access digital tools and apps to map waste hotspots,
      organize collection routes, and connect with recycling centres. They explore how AI and simple
      sensors can sort materials faster and how 3D printing can give plastic a second life.

   <p className="text-gray-700 leading-relaxed">
      The Nafasi Learning Programme supports street-connected children 
      and youth to reclaim their right to education, protection, and dignity. 
      ‚ÄòNafasi‚Äô which means space or opportunity in Swahili, reflects our belief 
      that every young person deserves a chance to learn and to belong.
      <br></br>
      Through mobile street schools, creative arts, and sports for transformation, 
      ECN builds pathways from the street to structured learning environments. 
      The programme integrates psychosocial care, family reintegration, and vocational 
      training to empower youth toward independence.
      <br></br>
      Each child‚Äôs story begins in struggle but evolves through education from survival 
      to learning, from learning to leadership. One example is a group of former street 
      boys in Nairobi who, after completing ECN‚Äôs vocational program, now operate a community 
      transport service using trollies that supports their families and funds younger children‚Äôs school fees.
      <br></br>
      Through the Nafasi Programme, ECN journeys with street-connected children and youth by meeting them where 
      they are, listening to their stories, and walking beside them as they discover spaces and opportunities to survive, learn, and thrive.
