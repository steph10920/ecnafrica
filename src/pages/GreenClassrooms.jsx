                Using solar-powered learning hubs, youth access digital tools and apps to map waste hotspots, 
                organize collection routes, and connect with recycling centres. They explore how AI and simple

            Changing the Culture, One Street at a Time
            </h3> 
          <p>
            Urban Green Minds is not only cleaning up waste, it‚Äôs cleaning up perceptions.
            It teaches that every person and every piece of waste has value.
            Through music, street art, and public campaigns, the youth become ambassadors of change, 
            inspiring entire neighbourhoods to rethink their habits and embrace recycling as a way of life.

          </p>
          <p>
            By teaching the value of trees and sustainability, the program helps
            communities adapt to climate challenges while fostering unity and
            hope for a greener future.
